Welcome to ADABOX 010 - RAINBOW TRELLIS!

The Trellis comes loaded with a drum machine demo. There are four
'voices' (drums) named voice01.wav through voice04.wav. You can 
put in any audio files you like to replace these defaults. Just make
sure they are in Stereo, 22KHz, 16-bit uncompressed WAV format.

You can change the tempo by tilting the board to the right or left 
while playing.

Delete or rename the welcome.wav file to stop it from playing on bootup

We have more projects, demos and information about the Trellis M4 
on the ADABOX site at https://learn.adafruit.com/adabox010

(There's probably even newer code for this drum machine demo!)
