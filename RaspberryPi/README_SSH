10/23/20: Found out how to ssh without internet via ethernet cable.


On RPi:
Plug in ethernet cable and power on
Login
$sudo raspi-config
5 interfacing options
P2 SSH
Enable
Reboot
$hostname
This will show you what the hostname of the pi is. For the Navio2, the default is navio. You can also see this information by logging on to the RPi and looking at the bottom left.
$hostname -I
This will show you the IP address from the ethernet cable.


On Laptop running linux:
Plug in ethernet cable (Using ethernet to usb adapter)
Go to settings
Go to Network
Click the settings under USB Ethernet
Click the IPv4 tab
Change the IPv4 Method to “Link-Local Only”
Click “Apply” at top right
Open Terminal
$hostname
$hostname -I
You need to make sure an IP address is now appearing with the same first 6-digits as the RPi’s IP address.
$ssh pi@navio.local
Type “yes”
Enter Password

On laptop running Mac OS: 
open "network preferences"
select your Ethernet connection on the left hand side of the box
Check that you have “Using DHCP” selected for “Configure IPv4” option
check that “Location” at the top of the dialog box has “Automatic” selected for your network configuration
run 'ssh pi@navio.local' 
Type "yes" 
enter password
