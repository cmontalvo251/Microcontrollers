# quadcopter
This is my Arduino Due based quadcopter. The language is C++ with about 2500 lines of code.

If you want to use code from this repo, you use it at your own risk. I am not responsible for any damage or injury resulting from anybody using this software. Building a quadcopter from scratch can become dangerous. The props spin very fast and sooner or later, you will make a mistake.

Be patient. Be careful. Be a good engineer.

## MIQ: Does it fly?
Yes, it does. Check this out: [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZlPoww-kpc)

## How does it look like?

## Software
The quadcopter uses a 1st order complementary filter for sensor fusion with body-to-earth-frame transformations. It measures roll, pitch, yaw, rotating rates, height, climbrate and accelerations. Also, the complementary filter does not use constant filter coefficients, but changes them during flight to put more trust in the accelerometer or the gyroscope.

The PID controller consists of two stages. The 1st stage takes the actual angles from sensor fusion and the desired angle from the radio controller and determines a desired rotating rate. The second stage takes this desired rotating rate and compares it to the actual rate. The output is then send to the motors. This two stage design is a very common.

## Damages during build
- 4 props
- Once I accidentally started the quadcopter with props mounted in full throttle about one meter next to me. Fortunately, nothing happened. It flew in the opposite direction and crashed.
- At an early stage of the software, the quadcopter fell two times from a height of about 5 to 10 meters. I never found out why.
