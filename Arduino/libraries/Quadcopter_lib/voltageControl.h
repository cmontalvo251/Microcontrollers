* 
* 
* 		Z Diode Protects Arduino Input: Here 5.1 Volts and max current of 100mA (can also be 3.3 V with R1 = 0 Ohm).
* 
* 		Let's say we want to measure voltages up to 20 V.
* 
* 			R0 limits the current:
* 
* 			R0 > (20V - 5.1V)/100mA = 149 Ohm
* 				
* 			Let's say R0 = 1k. Maximum current then is (20-5.1)/1k = 14.9mA.
* 
* 		At 20 V battery voltage the Z-Diode should start limiting.
* 
* 			R12 = R1+R2.
* 
* 			R12/(R0 + R12)*20 = 5.1 -> R12 < R0/(20/5.1 - 1) = 342 Ohm ~ 300 Ohm
* 
* 		If the Z-Diode is limiting, the max. voltage over R2 is 3.3 Volts. Let's say even 2.5 Volts to be on the save side.
* 
* 			R2/R12*5.1 = 2.5 -> R2 = 2.5/5.1*300 = 147 Ohm ~ 150 Ohm
* 
* 			R1 = R12 - R2 = 150 Ohm
* 
* 		Scale factor in Arduino is:
* 
* 			scale = U_R2 / R2 * (R0+R1+R2) = U_R2 * 8.6666
* 
* 			Measure the voltage U_R2 over R2, multiply with 8.6666 and you have the battery voltage.
* 
* 		Minimum Resolution: 3.3/1024*8.6666 = 0.02792 V = 27.9 mV
* 
* 		Maximum Resolution: 3.3/4095*8.6666 = 0.0069 V = 6.9 mV
* 
* 		Maximum Measurable Voltage: 5.1/(R1+R2)*(R0+R1+R2) = 22.1 Volts. Above that voltage Arduino always shows the same value since Z-Diode is limiting.
