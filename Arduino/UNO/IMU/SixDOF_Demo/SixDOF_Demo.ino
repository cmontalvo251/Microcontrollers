//In order to install the FreeSixIMU library you need to 
//click Sketch>Import Library...>Add Library and Click the ZIP file to add
//Once it's added though you should just be able to compile this code no problem.

#include <FreeSixIMU.h> //header file for Sixdof IMU code
#include <FIMU_ADXL345.h> //this is the accelerometer
#include <FIMU_ITG3200.h> //this is the rate gyro

#define DEBUG
#ifdef DEBUG
#include "DebugUtils.h" //Simple debug flags programs
#endif

#include "CommunicationUtils.h" //Looks like commands to write serially
#include <Wire.h> //Built in Arduino read and write buffer code

//float q[4]; //hold q values 
//float val[9];
float Values[6];
float PQR[3];
float Euler[3];

// Set the FreeIMU object
FreeSixIMU my3IMU = FreeSixIMU(); //This class is defined in FreeSixIMU.h
//this FreeSixIMU class has acc and gyro classes in it.
//the constructor for this class initializes the acc and gyro and initializes
//all the variables it needs

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200); //REVIST - this needs to be the same as the processing code
  Wire.begin(); 
  //Normally this code is called from setup() at user code
  //but some people reported that joining I2C bus earlier
  //apparently solved problems with master/slave conditions.
  //Uncomment if needed (copied from line 35 of FIMU_ITG3200.cpp)

  delay(5); //pause for 5 milliseconds - again most likely tuned to make sure everything comes up 
  //correctly
  my3IMU.init(); //init with no arguments runs the init routine without fast mode
  //I honestly don't think fastmode is important to learn but I might read it later
  //ok so in the init routine we turn on the gyro and the accelerometer and calibrate
  //the gyro by taking 128 measurements and averaging all the measurements
  //all the filter and bandwidth parameters seem to be internal circuitry that operates
  //without code.
  delay(5);

  //That's it for setup
}


void loop() { 
  //Now we get the quaternions from the sensors
  //Ok I went through this code. The code really just takes the raw accel and gyro data
  //and integrates it using a DCM filter to get the quaternions
  //so an exercise would be to take the raw accel and gyro data and obtain the quaternions
  //using the method obtained here. That would be a fun project anyway.
  //Perhaps I could write my own routine where I output the raw accel and gyro 
  //data to a text file and then they obtain the quaternions
  //my3IMU.getQ(q);
  my3IMU.getEuler(Euler);
  my3IMU.getValues(Values);
  
  //getValues grabs accelerometer and rate gyro data so I just need the rate gyro data
  for (int idx = 0;idx<3;idx++)

  //Send PQR to Computer
