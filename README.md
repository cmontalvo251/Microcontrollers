We've got ambient lighting here which uses USB from Processing - You need to grab ScreenCaptureCode from my Repo called Processing_Apps

We've got blinky which just makes a light blink 

and finally we've got Smooth_Transitions which doesn't use processing and just smoothly transitions the LEDs on a random color generator

I've since added a ton of 6DOF arduino shield code. Most of it is not mine since I downloaded it from DFRduino but 
I am editing it to fit my needs.
