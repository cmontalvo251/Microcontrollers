We've got ambient lighting here which uses USB from Processing - You need to grab ScreenCaptureCode from my Repo called Processing_Apps

We've got blinky which just makes a light blink 

and finally we've got Smooth_Transitions which doesn't use processing and just smoothly transitions the LEDs on a random color generator
